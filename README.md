# Tribbler
Tribbler is a course project in Distributed System class
# Functionality
1. Built a Twitter-like information dissemination service using RPC calls in Golang that allows users to post messages, read messages, and subscribe to receive other users' messages.
2. Implemented consistent hashing on back-end storage servers, and a lease-based cache consistency mechanism that cache frequently-accessed messages to improve the scalability of the system.
